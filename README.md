Hello! My name is David Oikle.

I'm a television technicain learning web development on the side via The Odin Project, Code Academy, and trusty Google.

Most of the repositories here will be from the lessons I'm doing, with a few personal projects that I'm working on sprinkled here and there. Take a look, and let me know what you think!
